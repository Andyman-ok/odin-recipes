    <h1>Egg Whites</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This is an easy "meal" if you will. It is fast to make
                    and can be kept int he fridge and grabbed in 
                    the morning on the way to work for a convenient and high 
                    protetin breakfast.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Liquid Egg Whites (250 mL)</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Intructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour egg whites into a microwave safe bowl</li>
                    <li>Microwave for 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>Take out and stir, breaking up the solid parts and mixing 
                        around the liquid. This will give the eggs a more 
                        consistent texture.<em>Note that the bowl may be hot, so
                        use precaution when mixing the contents</em></li>
                    <li>Microwave for another 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>That's it. Feel free to add minor additions such as
                        salt and pepper, cayenne pepper, Sriracha sauce, etc. to 
                        fit your pallette. I personally eat them plain as I enjoy
                        the egg flavour and texture on its own</li>
                </ol>
