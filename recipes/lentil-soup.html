        <h1>Lentil Soup</h1>
        <img src="../recipe-images/Lentil-Soup-1.jpg" alt="Lentil Soup in Pot">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a hearty lentil soup recipe that 
            will warm you up on a cold day or you can
            prepare 5 meals of this throughout the week
            to reheat in the microwave. I personally
            prepare this for my weekday dinners every day
            and sometimes accompany the meal with some 
            chicken, but you should know that this recipe
            on its own is vegetarian.
