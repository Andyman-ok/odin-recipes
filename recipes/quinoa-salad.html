        <h1>Quinoa Salad</h1>
        <img src="../recipe-images/Salad-1.jpg" alt="quinoa">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a nutritious salad that will leave 
            you feeling energized for the day. I like
            to bring this daily during weekdays for my
            lunches at work.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Part 1 Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Cup of Quinoa</li> 
                    <li>2 Cups of Water Dependant on 
                        type of quinoa used (eg whole
                        grain or white)</li>
                    <li>Prepare a large bowl that you
                        be able to mix all of the ingredients
                         in. <em>Be aware that the quinoa 
                        will absorb the water and expand 
                        when finding an appropriately 
                        sized bowl.</em></li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Part 2 Ingredients</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
                    <li>1 Bell Pepper (Red, Yellow, 
                        or Orange as green is too bitter
                        in taste)</li>
                    <li>1 Red Onion (if red onions are
                        out of season, then sweet onions
                        can be used for similar flavour)</li>
                    <li>1 Can of Corn Niblets (341 mL)</li>
                    <li>1 Can of Chick Peas (540 mL)</li>
                    <li>1/4 Cup of Olive Oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 Cup of Lemon Juice (Can adjust
                        to preferred flavour/acidity)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp of Vinegar</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Part 1</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare quinoa. <em>I mix the quinoa
                         and the water before waiting for the 
                         water to begin to boil. This way I can
                         proceed to Instructions Part 2 while I
                         prepare the rest of the salad or 
                        prepare other meals while it boils.</em></li>
                    <li>Once quinoa has absorbed all of the 
                        water, move the quinoa to a large mixing 
                        bowl. We will use this to combine and mix 
                        all of the ingredients.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Part 2</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mince your 2 cloves of garlic. The finer 
                        they are miced, the stronger the garlic
                        flavour you will notice</li>
                    <li>Dice the onion into small 1cm cube </li>
                    <li>Cut the pepper up into 1-2cm cubes</li>
                    <li>Combine the garlic, onion, and pepper 
                        with the quinoa and mix in the mixing 
                        bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the olive oil, vinegar, and 
                        lemon juice into the mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>Salad can be served immediately, 
                        or stored for up to 5 days.</li>
